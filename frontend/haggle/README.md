# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   rm -rf ./node_modules ./components/ui babel.config.js && npx gluestack-ui init && npx gluestack-ui add --all
   npm install
   ```

2. Get a build ready (for development)

Refer to [these expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/)

- Run `eas login`
- Run `eas build:configure`
- Run `eas build --platform ios --profile development`

3. Set up the development environment

You'll need Expo to run the native app on your local simulator:

https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=ios&device=simulated&mode=development-build

4. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
